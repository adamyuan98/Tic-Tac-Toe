TIC TAC TOE

14-Feb-20222

This project is aimed to be lightweight and help get more into programming and touching more code.
Project should have clear, easily completable goals that enable learning. It should be imperfect.
I am not including GIT or specific requirements in this project which distracts from the coding - want to focus on getting the job done.

I Want to work on basic web dev skills such as:
- Setting up and hosting a basic web app
- Basics of react and frontend
- Potentially extensions

MVP requirements:
- Tic tac toe web app with graphical interface of the grid that allows move made by pressing cell
